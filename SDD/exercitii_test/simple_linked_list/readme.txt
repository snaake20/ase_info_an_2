Types of Linked Lists:
  - Simple Linked List – In this type of linked list, one can move or traverse the linked list in only one direction. where the next pointer of each node points to other nodes but the next pointer of the last node points to NULL. It is also called “Singly Linked List”. ✅
  - Circular Linked List – In this type of linked list, the last node of the linked list contains the link of the first/head node of the linked list in its next pointer. ✅

Basic operations on Linked Lists:
  Deletion (start ✅, end ✅, by position ✅) delete at key ✅
  Insertion (start ✅, end ✅, by position ✅) insert before key ✅ (text) Tema: inserare dupa Golescu (dupa anumite criterii if node->info->nume == "Golescu ...") ✅ si inserare la mijloc ✅
  Search (based on the info) (iterative ✅ and recursive ✅) -> returns pos ✅
  Display ✅
  Find length (iterative ✅ and recursive ✅) 

Other operations:
  - Sort the list (exchange info not pointers) ✅ (am belit pl daca pica asta la test)
  - Reverse the list ✅
  - Count the nodes (circular list) ✅
  - Split list (half idk really) ✅
